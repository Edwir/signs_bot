Signs Bot [signs_bot]
=====================

## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

A robot controlled by signs.

The robot can be controlled by means of text commands written on (street) signs.
The mod provides already programmed signs like "move" or "turn_left", but also a generic "command" sign to be programmed by the player.
If the robot finds a sign on its path, it executes all sign commands.
